Introduction
Churn modelling is a predictive modeling task that involves identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service. In this repository, we utilize the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to perform churn modelling on the provided dataset.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

Python (version >= 3.6)
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-modelling.git
cd churn-modelling
Run the Python script:
python churn_modelling.py
Preprocessing Steps
The script includes the following preprocessing steps:

Categorical Feature Encoding: Convert categorical features ('Geography' and 'Gender') to numerical values.
Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values with the most frequent value in each column.
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Remove columns ('RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname') that do not contribute to the model.
Min-Max Normalization: Scale numerical features to a specific range using Min-Max normalization.
Random Shuffling: Shuffle the dataset randomly.
kNN Classification: Apply the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm with different values of k (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11).
Accuracy Calculation: Evaluate the model's accuracy for each k value.
Results
The script prints the accuracy for different values of k (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) and the overall accuracy. The kNN algorithm's performance is assessed based on these accuracy scores.

Introduction
Churn modelling is a crucial task in predicting customer behavior, specifically identifying customers who are likely to stop using a service. This repository demonstrates the application of the kNN algorithm to perform churn modelling.

Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version >= 3.6)
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using the following command:

bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-modelling-knn.git
cd churn-modelling-knn
Run the Python script:


python churn_modelling_knn.py
Preprocessing Steps
The script includes the following preprocessing steps:

Categorical Feature Encoding: Converts categorical features ('Geography' and 'Gender') into numerical values.
Handling Missing Values: Fills missing values with the most frequent value in each column.
Drop Unnecessary Columns: Removes columns ('RowNumber', 'CustomerId', 'Surname') that do not contribute to the model.
Min-Max Normalization: Scales numerical features to a specific range using Min-Max normalization.
Random Shuffling: Shuffles the dataset randomly.
Algorithm Overview
The kNN algorithm is applied to classify each test example by finding the k nearest neighbors in the training set. The script calculates the distance between the test example and both positive (Exited = 1) and negative (Exited = 0) classes. The predicted class is determined based on the distances, and the overall accuracy is computed.

Results
The script prints the overall accuracy for the kNN classification on the test set.
